# OpenCV-Detector-Package-2026-Python-
Hi! Thanks for using ODP 26! This package contains camera detector with color detection, shape detection and more. Also i made a modular settings system at the script so its easy to configure! Enjoy!
Detector.py contains all the script inside. If you find any bugs or you have any idea you can contact to me, Thanks!

Latest Update: v1.3.3 - 20 January 2026 - 23:17 (+3)

Just download the py file for the system, others are txt or license so you dont need them.
