# ----------------- SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (HOW IT WORKS) ----------------- #
# 1. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
#    The system features a self-healing dependency check. It verifies OpenCV and 
#    NumPy on startup; if missing, it auto-installs via subprocess and restarts 
#    to maintain environment integrity.
#
# 2. MODULAR CONFIGURATION LAYER:
#    Global parameters (UI labels, feature toggles, camera specs) are decoupled 
#    into modular dictionaries. This architecture enables "tuning without touching"
#    the core computer vision algorithms.
#
# 3. VISION & PROCESSING PIPELINE:
#    A. ACQUISITION: High-speed real-time frame capture from CAM_CONFIG index.
#    B. PRE-PROCESSING: Converts to HSV color space and applies adaptive 
#       Gaussian Blurring to eliminate digital flicker and sensor jitter.
#    C. LIGHTING STABILIZATION: (New v1.3.3) Uses Histogram Equalization to 
#       maintain detection accuracy under variable outdoor lighting conditions.
#    D. MORPHOLOGICAL REFINEMENT: Executes OPEN/CLOSE operations to eliminate 
#       pixel gaps and "ghosting" artifacts in low-quality streams.
#
# 4. SCIENTIFIC OBJECT RECOGNITION:
#    A. CONTOUR ANALYSIS: Extracts structural outlines and filters by min_area.
#    B. POLYGON APPROXIMATION: Implements Douglas-Peucker algorithm for vertex 
#       mapping.
#    C. CIRCULARITY ANALYSIS: (New v1.3.3) Uses mathematical roundness formula 
#       (4*PI*Area / Perimeter^2) to verify circles regardless of pixel distortion.
#    D. TARGET TRACKING: Dynamic Bounding Box logic (LOCKED) for visual identification.
#
# 5. TELEMETRY & UI:
#    Real-time HUD (Heads-Up Display) rendering for Shape/Color labels, 
#    performance telemetry (FPS/Latency), and crosshair color analysis.
