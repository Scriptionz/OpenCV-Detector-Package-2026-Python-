# ----------------- SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (HOW IT WORKS) ----------------- #
# 1. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
#    The script automatically checks for OpenCV and NumPy. If missing, it uses 
#    subprocess to install them and restarts itself to ensure a clean environment.
#
# 2. CONFIGURATION LAYER:
#    All system parameters (UI labels, feature toggles, camera settings) are 
#    stored in modular dictionaries (LANGUAGE_SETTINGS, SETTINGS, CAM_CONFIG).
#    This allows high-level customization without altering the core logic.
#
# 3. VISION PIPELINE:
#    A. Image Acquisition: Captures real-time frames from the specified camera index.
#    B. Pre-processing: Applies high-intensity Gaussian Blur on HSV space 
#       to eliminate digital flickering and sensor noise.
#    C. Color Masking: Uses inRange filtering to isolate specific color frequencies.
#    D. Morphology (Closing): Fills small gaps within shapes and removes ghost pixels.
#
# 4. OBJECT RECOGNITION:
#    A. Contour Analysis: Extracts shape outlines and filters by modular area settings.
#    B. Polygon Approximation: Uses Douglas-Peucker (approxPolyDP) for vertex count.
#    C. Geometric Labeling: Classifies shapes based on corner counts (3, 4, 5, 6, 8+).
#
# 5. USER INTERFACE:
#    Real-time rendering of detection boxes, labels, and the center-point 
#    color analyzer on the video stream.
#
# > and a extra note, if you run application and can't close it, that means you didn't check settings. "q" key to stop it and you can change it.
